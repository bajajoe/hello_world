Grew up in S. La, loved being on the water, went to U in California and graduated in Naval Architecture from Cal. Went to work for the USN and worked on 1) full scale trail design verification of ships and submarines (CVN-71, MCM-1, etc)  and mapping & envirnmental systems for special project nuclear submarines (SSN-683 & SSN-687). Got bit by the tech bug and moved back to California (San Diego)
